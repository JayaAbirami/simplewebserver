          <p class="card-text"> The unanimous ruling is specific to Colorado, but it also overrides challenges brought in other states.

            Colorado had barred Mr Trump from its Republican primary, arguing he incited the 2021 Capitol riot.
            
            The court ruled that only Congress, rather than the states, has that power.
            
            The top court's decision clears the way for Mr Trump to compete in the Colorado primary scheduled for Tuesday.</p>

            A recent retiree is, like millions of people all over the globe, taking his first steps into running in a bid to break the boredom.
            
            He's been riding his bike locally but is fed up with just pedalling "around the block".</p>
